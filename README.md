# About project Angie

Angie is a church management centered on what's at the heart of all ministry - people. The platform simplifies the process of managing people and their relationships between each other and the church, keeping track of data across the organization and creates a foundation for adding new features that are specific to your church.

# The tech

This repo holds the Angie church relationship management system (RMS) server. 

## Getting started

Clone the repository:
`git clone git@github.com:kanzucode/angie-client.git`

Install the dependencies:
`npm install`

**PS:** If you don't have `npm` installed, check out this guide https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

For your development environment, add some "dummy" (seed) data:

```
cd src/data
node seed.ts
```

Finally, start the party:
`npm start`

This repo works with the server at https://github.com/kanzucode/angie-client so be sure to set that up too.
